# Face Recognition System

# Description

This project is a real-time face recognition system that captures video from a webcam, processes the frames to detect faces, and compares them against a known set of faces loaded from a CSV file. The system accurately identifies known individuals and displays their names on the video feed in real-time.

# Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

## Libraries and Frameworks:

OpenCV: Real-time computer vision tasks such as capturing video from the webcam, detecting faces, and drawing rectangles around them.

dlib: Efficient face detection capabilities, providing robustness in detecting faces under various conditions.

NumPy: Numerical computations and array manipulations, facilitating data processing tasks in face recognition.

face_recognition: Face detection, encoding, and comparison, utilizing pre-trained deep learning models for accurate face recognition.

scikit-learn: Machine learning models such as classification and regression trees, enhancing face recognition accuracy through advanced algorithms.

# Key Features
